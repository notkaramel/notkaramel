# Hi, I'm Antoine! 👋
Electrical/Software Engineering and Music Technology at McGill University. A Linux enthusiast who lives the command line.

I learned most things as I go. My current interests and skillset includes:
- Cloud Computing/System Admin (Linux)
- Frontend dev (JS, TailwindCSS, SvelteKit)
- Backend dev (expressJS, Flask, Spring Boot)
- Analog/Digital Signal Processing + Audio Processing
- and a lot more! 

## Have a project in mind and want to collab? 🤔
I'm down to take up any challenges in the field of Software-Electrical-Music Tech. [Send me an email](mailto:hoangtuan11102@gmail.com), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinephan/) if you have an idea and is looking for a teammate!
