# Hi, I'm Antoine! 👋 
Electrical, Software, and Music Technology. A Linux enthusiast who lives the command line (_I use Arch btw_).

# Interests
I'm self-teaching web app development (primarily client-side and UI/UX design) and embedded systems for wireless audio devices.

# Have a project in mind and want to collab? 🤔
I'm down to take up new challenges in the field of Software-Electrical-Music Tech. [Send me an email](mailto:antoine.phan@mail.mcgill.ca), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinephan/) if you have an idea and is looking for a teammate!

My Tech stack? Everything is a tool and it would not take much time for me to catch up and able to use any tech for the job.
