# Linux configuration
---
## Motivation
Every now and then, I encounter a literally breaking bug(s), or just impulsive thought that I want to reinstall and start fresh.

Starting off with my own version of Arch Installation Docs was nice, since I have done that so many times. There was also the dual-boot version. Both were in `.docx` file and stored on OneDrive, but since GitHub allows more coder-friendly interface, I decided to migrate everything to a repo. What's better than my own GitHub front page repo, since Linux is now a part of my personality (I'm the nice one, trust me).
