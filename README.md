# Hi, I'm Antoine! üëã 

I'm studying Electrical Engineering at McGill University (Montr√©al, Canada), with two minors in Software Engineering and Musical Science & Technology. My interest and speciality meet in the [crossroads](https://youtu.be/kx5TWKPE5sU) of electronics, software design, and music tech!

I would love to collaborate on projects, so feel free to reach out to me through [email](mailto:antoine.phan@mail.mcgill.ca) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinephan/) (and please let me know you found me from GitHub!).

> @notkaramel is pronouned `/n…ítÀàk…ë…π.m…ôl/` or "not-ka-ra-mel". The name originates from the French dessert **cr√®me caramel** üçÆ (a.k.a *flan* or *custard*).
